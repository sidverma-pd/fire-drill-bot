Fire Drill Templates
===================

Define custom fire drill templates in a simple format.
Each template can specify:
- title: The incident title
- urgency: high, low, or critical
- description: Detailed description of the scenario
- expected_tta: Expected time to acknowledge (seconds)
- expected_ttr: Expected time to resolve (seconds)
- difficulty: easy, medium, or hard
- category: database, network, application, infrastructure, etc.
